# Home-Assistant

This is a begin of my back-up and setup of home assistant. 
the backup is a start of some of my automations from node-red and ONLY the custom files I made for the Swiss Army Knife card.
also a overview of my own made custom cards based on the fantastic swiss army knife card.

Just begon with the Swiss Army Knife Card and made a awsome view this way

If you want to use my cards and overview you have to install SAK first and make that work.

the custom cards are bases on SAK10 and Wide card Examples.

You can copy paste each floor section of my and edit on your needs
edit each card that is in there of just empty the field and copy a individual card in the code see my custom SAK cards.
picture example and complete code to copy.

I hope with this I can help more people to use it also.
