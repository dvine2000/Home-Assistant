OWN SETUP FOR THE LUX COLORS

NEW FILE MADER FOR THE POWER SENSOR WALL PLUG CARD

colorstops-power-template.yaml

I did not have setup 0, this way there is always a little blue line below if power is off. Gives the card nice look.
you can setup 0 and setup a color like you want.
Don't forget to change the scale in power sensor card min and max like you want. Else the segarc won't work with all colors

                  - type: 'segarc'

                  scale:
                      min: 10
                      max: 2200


Can setup up own colors like you want
